These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then You may not access the Service.

Our Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information when You use the Application and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You. Please read Our Privacy Policy carefully before using Our Service.

You may not impersonate the Company, Bots by the Company or people associated with the Company. All assets and names are intellectual property of the Company and underlie Copyright.

The Company cannot be held responsible to any harm done to your Discord Server. Use the bot at your own risk and make sure to give minimal permissions in order to reduce potential risks.

We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that You visit.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

The Service and the Materials are provided to You on an "AS IS" basis, with all faults and defects, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. The Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, licensors, and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. The Company makes no representation that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve intended results, be compatible with other software, operate without interruption, meet performance standards, or be error-free. Your use of the Services is at Your sole risk. The Company also does not guarantee that the Services will always be secure, error-free, or function without delays, disruptions, or imperfections. These disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.

## Governing Law

The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

## Severability, Waiver, and Limitation of Liability

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### Waiver

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE TEAM BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR OTHER MATERIALS ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TEAM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THESE TERMS DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

## Translation Interpretation

These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service. You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.

## Changes to These Terms and Conditions
